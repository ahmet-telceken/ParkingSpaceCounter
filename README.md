# Parking Space Counter

- ParkingSpacePicker.py
    
    1- First select and deselect parking spaces and put them all in a list
    
    For this reason, we created posList[]. When we select the point on image, it has only 2 points (x, y)
    
    1.1- We add weight and height to our points to draw a rectangle.

    At the end of the day, we knew all of the parking spaces and saved them on a pickle file, as well as drew rectangles on them.

- main.py
    
    Open the pickle file which we create on ParkingSpacePicker.py.
    
    We need to tell whether this region has a car present or not.
    
    1-We can do that by looking at its pixel count, 
    
    2-Convert this image into a binary imageÂ based on its edges and corners
    
    And then from there we can say that; 
    
    If it doesnt have a lot of edges or corners, then it means there is no car.

    We applied the dilated as the last step when converting the image to binary format.
    
    ![Untitled](readme_images/Untitled%202.png)
    

We need to count the pixels from the dilated image and how many pixels each of these car spaces has.

```
# if count < 800 then color is green = empty,
# otherwise parkspace is not empty = red
```

We also include "spaceCounter," which counts empty spaces and already knows how many parking spaces are available from the pickle file.
